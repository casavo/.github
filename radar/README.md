## Quadrants

The quadrants represent different kinds of blips.

| quadrant | explanation |
| -- | -- |
| Languages and Frameworks | Your codebase can be written with a meagniful language, but sometimes you require library to do your job :wink: |
| Tools | These can be components, such as databases, software development tools, such as versions control systems; or more generic categories of tools, such as the notion of polyglot persistence. |
| Platforms | Things that we build software on top of such as mobile technologies like Android, virtual platforms like the JVM, or generic kinds of platforms like hybrid clouds. |
| Techniques | These include elements of a software development process, such as experience design; and ways of structuring software, such as microservices. |

Note: don't care too much to put a blip in the "perfect" quadrant, the rings are more important :)

## Rings

The rings indicate what stage in the adoption lifecycle we think they should be in. The closer a bip is to the center of the radar, the sooner or more frequent you have to deal with it.

| quadrant | explanation |
| -- | -- |
| Adopt | represents blips that we think you should seriously consider using. We don't say that you should use these for every project; any tool should only be used in an appropriate context. However we do think that a blip in the Adopt ring represents something where there's no doubt that it's proven and mature for use. |
| Trial | is for blips that we think are ready for use, but not as completely proven as those in the Adopt ring. So for most organizations we think you should use these on a trial basis, to decide whether they should be part of your toolkit. Typically we've used trial blips in production, but we realize that readers are more cautious than us. |
| Assess | are things to look at closely, but not necessarily trial yet - unless you think they would be a particularly good fit for you. Typically, blips in the Assess ring are things that we think are interesting and worth keeping an eye on. |
| Hold | ring is for things that, even though they are accepted in the industry, we haven't had a good experience with. Therefore we are calling them out to warn you that you may run into trouble with them as well. Sometimes it means we think they're irredeemably flawed; or just being misused. We do place things in the Hold ring that we wish the industry wouldn't use. |

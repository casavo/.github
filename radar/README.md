## Quadrants

The quadrants represent different kinds of blips. 
A "blip" refers to an individual technology or technique that is being assessed and tracked on the Tech Radar.

| quadrant | explanation |

| Languages and Frameworks | Your codebase can be written with a meagniful language, but sometimes you require library to do your job :wink: |
| Tools | These can be components, such as databases, software development tools, such as versions control systems; or more generic categories of tools, such as the notion of polyglot persistence. |
| Platforms | Things that we build software on top of such as mobile technologies like Android, virtual platforms like the JVM, or generic kinds of platforms like hybrid clouds. |
| Techniques | These include elements of a software development process, such as experience design; and ways of structuring software, such as microservices. |

Note: don't care too much to put a blip in the "perfect" quadrant, the rings are more important :)

## Rings

The rings indicate what stage in the adoption lifecycle we think they should be in. The closer a bip is to the center of the radar, the sooner or more frequent you have to deal with it.

| ring | explanation |
| --     | -- |
| Adopt  | Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purposes. Low risk and recommended to be widely used. |
| Trial  | Technologies that we are using and have seen to solve a real problem. Slightly more risky than adopt, and with limited shared knowledge across organization. |
| Assess | Technologies used in our organization, but unproven. You may find teams that have started a prototyping effort, but invest on them has the higher risks. |
| Hold   | Technologies not recommended to be used for new project. Used previously by some teams or all teams, but superseded by other technologies. |
